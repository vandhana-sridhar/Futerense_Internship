git is a tool installed in the system, it can work with remote repository. it is a version control system. it is a source management tool. We can do versioning of the code file. vcs
it needs a traget , which should be a repository like github or bitbucket.

github can be private or public

git clone- we can downlaod a copy of a file from the repository in the local system

to copy a file from local to remote repository

get add "file name"
git commit -m "added a new file"
git push


git pull - update your local git repository , to sync the remote and local git repository 

git branch - master branch
we can create many branches
we create branches to create a copy of the main branch, a testing branch for the people working on the project. to make changes or test so it won't affect the main branch as it is loaclised.


git tag my_tag- it helps you identify diff projects and repositories. some projects use react and angiuler. so we tag the angular projects with angular  and raect with react tags. so when we need it we can seacg the project using the tag. it is used to annotate a file or a repository.
